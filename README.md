## background
  First, why develop mits? The reason is that I want to drink a lot of water every day, but I keep forgetting about it. So I tried find some tools to prompt me to to this. but unfortunately, I searched for a long time but could't find anything suitable. Then you know what happened, I decided develop mits.
